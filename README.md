### 💬 What is *Hacktoberfest*? 💬
Hacktoberfest is a celebration 🎊 of contributing to open source at Github! Every year, on the month of October, this event begins. 

### 💬 What do you do at Hacktoberfest? 💬
For the repos that have signed up to Hacktoberfest, you can contribute to and make a pr, to hope for a **Hacktoberfest-Accepted** tag on your PR. Once you have `4` valid PR's, you have completed Hacktoberfest!

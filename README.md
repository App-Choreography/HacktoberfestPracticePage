### 💬 What is *Hacktoberfest*? 💬
Hacktoberfest is a celebration 🎊 of contributing to open source at Github! Every year, on the month of October, this event begins. 

### 💬 What do you do at Hacktoberfest? 💬
For the repos that have signed up to Hacktoberfest, you can contribute to and make a pr, to hope for a **Hacktoberfest-Accepted** tag on your PR. Once you have `4` valid PR's, you have completed Hacktoberfest!

### 💬 What are the rewards? 💬
Once all 4 valid PR's are completed, you will get the option for some c😎😎l *swag* or the option to plant a tree 🌲. But the best reward is... you have learned open source 🤗.

## Today, we are going to make our own Markdown Social Profiles!

> If you need help on mastering Markdown, see [👉 Here 👈](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

If your PR is successful, you will get the digital sticker designed personally for you!
### 🤞 Hopefully, this is what you shall get : 🤞
